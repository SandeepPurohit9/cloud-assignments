## Description 
🚀 Open-source curated certification assignment & solution repo for my fellow professional classmates.

## Objective
Since being a working professional completing assignment is very tedious work, my fellow classmates have faced similar issues & we are falling back.

So i've created a time saving solution for all of us, Here's how it will help.

### How to quickly complete assignments ? 😎

- Select the assignment in module folder
- Copy all the steps in a doc file
- Visit aws console , click screenshot while performing steps (practice is imp. not boring steps)
- add screenshot to doc file (I've not added images here as practicing is important)
- & Voila 🔥🔥🔥 !! ASSIGNMENT IS DONE 🥳 
- You can now submit assignment via email

### What if i faced any issue with steps? 😰

- Solve the issue with support team/other fellows & create a PR. see guides here [Contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### What if i am adding a new assignment solution in a module? 🤩
VERY SIMPLE
- create a new branch with `your-name/assignment-name`
- create a new empty file in module & copy [Templates/Skeleton.md](templates/skeleton.md) 
- start filling in steps
- if there are some complex steps with assignment add details to `troubleshoot` section of the file, so everyone can understand
- push the code & raise a PR , once PR is approved will add your name to contributors 🤩
- & Voila 🔥🔥🔥 !! THIS WILL HELP OTHER CLASSMATES 🥳
